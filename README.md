# Rite-of-Passage

The main character is a member of a tribe whose duty is to serve as the guardians of the heavens. The game takes place, or at least starts, on the day they come of age, when each member must go through the Great Temple, which has sections devoted to each of the gods, who issue challenges that correspond to their spheres of influence. Upon leaving the temple, they find the Heavens in ruins, and the endgame is going through the gods’ palace to defeat the evil within and avenge Heaven’s destruction.

The main character will not be given any gender, and will be wearing a traditional mask the whole game. Sticking with the tribal themes, their bladed weapons are made of materials like bone and horn.
		
In certain rooms of the Great Temple, there are crystals at which the player can spend gold obtained from killing enemies on supplies like ammunition for ranged weaponry, health extensions, etc..
